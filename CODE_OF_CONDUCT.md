# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the community as a whole

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Community members are expected to follow these guidelines and report any unacceptable behaviors or harassment to the community leaders.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the community leaders at `contact@openbuckets.io`.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at `contact@openbuckets.io`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction**: Community leaders will explain why the behavior was inappropriate and expect the person to stop the behavior.
2. **Warning**: If the behavior continues, the community leaders may issue a warning.
3. **Temporary Ban**: Continued violations will result in a temporary ban from community interaction.
4. **Permanent Ban**: In case of severe violations, individuals may be permanently banned from the community.
